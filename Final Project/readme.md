# Active Mixer 

## Overview

Active MOSFET mixer simulated with two-tone harmonic balance, measuring RF-to-IF conversion gain at the difference product fIF = fLO - fRF, with an operating-point check that the bias device remains in saturation (VDS > VDSat).

## Conversion Gain vs RF Input Power (prf)
- Gain is approximately constant at low RF input power, then compresses as prf increases

## Bias Device Saturation
- Shows VDS > VDSat
