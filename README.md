# Electronics II

## Overview
Analog integrated-circuit design focused on MOS and BJT amplifier stages: biasing, small-signal modeling, frequency response, differential and multistage amplifiers, and op-amp building blocks.

## Topics
- MOS circuits: DC operation and analysis
- Single-stage MOS amplifiers: design; DC and small-signal analysis
- Cascode amplifiers
- Current mirrors; active loads
- BJT and MOS differential amplifiers
- Monolithic operational amplifiers
- Output stages
- Frequency response
- Feedback fundamentals; amplifier topologies
